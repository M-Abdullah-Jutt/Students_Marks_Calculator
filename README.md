**Description:**
In the winter vocation of 2025, I worked on two projects: one is related to a Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, and the second is a Student Marks Calculator using Python.
I worked on a student marks calculator project after a pizza sales dashboard.
It was a great journey. I faced many challenges while designing a GUI (graphical user interface) and also saving and loading Excel or CSV files, but at last, after some days, I successfully developed it.

Must run the program on your machine and enjoy the output. 

It's possible you won't like it, but as a beginner, it's a great step for me towards the development industry.
